                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The current website for the Mar Thoma Church of Philadelphia provides very little helpful information for current church members, such as myself, and is not a site many people find themselves returning to. Over the course of 6 months, I took it on myself to redesign the website to a more informative and welcoming site for members of my church.</p>

        <!--Research-->
        <section class="cs-sub-sections">
            <div class="page-section">
                <img 
                    class="page-section-star"
                    src="" 
                    alt="pixel star"

                        Research:
                    </h2> 
                </div>
            </div>


            <p>Before I dove right into solving the problems the website had I first had to analyze the current website and understand what exactly was going on. Here’s what I found:</p>

            <div class="arrows-descr">
                <div>
                    <img src="" alt="pixel arrow pointing to the right">
                    <p>Nothing on the website stood out for users to remember by leading to its low engagement by current church members</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <img src="" alt="pixel arrow pointing to the right">
                    <p>All the information on the site was outdated</p>
                </div>
        
                <div>
                    <img src="" alt="pixel arrow pointing to the right">
                    <p>With lists of the church's organizations, there was barely information about what they did or who they could contact to find more</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>With the analysis done for the moment, I decided to figure out my target audience.</p>

            <img 
                src=""
                class="cs-section-images" 
                alt="User Persona Image for PMTC Case study"
            >

        </section>

        <!--Designing-->
        <div class="cs-sub-sections">
            <p>Through my process, I looked at the Web and other Church websites for inspiration. This allowed me to continuously make changes and edits to my wireframe. With each new change, I came to understand that I didn’t need to have a design similar to the original, and I overcame the fear of whitespace.</p>
            <p>When it came to choosing a color palette, I decided to use almost the same red hues as they are based on the Church's logo.</p>

            <img src="" class="cs-section-images" alt="Four swatches of colors red, dark red, grey and black that are shown in different opacities.">
        </div>

        <!--Testing-->
        <div class="cs-sub-sections">
            <p>After finishing up the design and animation for my prototype, I had three participants test out my prototype. </p>

            <p>First, I had each user interact with the original website with the goal of getting information from the Youth Fellowship Page. Then I had them note things about their experience. </p>

            <p>Afterwards, I had them do a similar task with my prototype.</p>

            <p>With the feedback I was given, I was able to make a few changes to my design.</p>
        </div>

        <!--Outcome-->
        <section class="cs-sub-sections">
            <p>Through this experience, as it was my first big task in the field of UX/UI Design, I had many ups and downs. Now that I have gone through all this, I have learned some valuable things.</p>

            <p>While having a personal connection to this project as a member of the church, I should have still focused more on the research first, rather than what I knew. User testing actually led me to come to terms with some problems I overlooked, which led to design changes.</p>

            <p>Rather than jumping straight into a wireframe, I should try to branch out my research, such as here, where I looked at other church websites for design inspirations. </p>

            <p>Overall, with this project, I got a better idea of the UX Workflow as well as get into the tool Figma. I learned to look not only at the design but also at the usability.  While this project isn’t perfect, it was definitely a great learning experience I worked through.</p>
